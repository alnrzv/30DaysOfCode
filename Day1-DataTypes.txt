Day 1: Data Types

Objective: We're discussing Data Types

Task: Complete thecode in the editor. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized. You must:
	1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
	2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
	3. Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
		1. Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line
		2. Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line
		3. Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line

        // Note: If you have trouble reading the entire String, please go back and review the Tutorial closely.

        System.out.println(i+a);
        /* Print the sum of the double variables on a new line. */
		System.out.println(d+b);
        /* Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line; 
        	the 's' variable above should be printed first. */
